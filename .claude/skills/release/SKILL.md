description: Cut a versioned per-target release of Stencil. m4l publishes to GitHub Releases (tag + asset + notes); vst is local-only since the paid pivot (CMakeLists VERSION bump + `make release-vst` to produce signed/notarized dmg AND pkg in dist/, no tag, no GH release — upload to Polar happens out of band). Verifies repo state, bumps semver, runs the build (vst), drafts notes (m4l), and walks each step with explicit user approval. `none` bump (vst only) keeps the current version and regenerates artifacts — for doc-only fixes to bundled files.

# Release Stencil

Cut a versioned per-target release. The first $ARGUMENT selects the
target (`m4l` or `vst`); the second is the bump (`major` / `minor` /
`patch` / `none`, default `patch`). `none` is vst-only — keep the
current version and regenerate artifacts only.

m4l publishes to GitHub Releases with tags namespaced as
`m4l-vX.Y.Z`. vst is local-only since the paid pivot — no tag, no GH
release; the in-tree `vst/CMakeLists.txt` `project(... VERSION …)`
is the version source of record, and the dmg + pkg are uploaded to
the paid platform (Polar) out of band.

No vst tags exist yet in this repo and none will be created going
forward. m4l remains a free GitHub Releases distribution
(tag + release + asset).

The release asset is target-specific, and the filename always embeds
the version (`-vX.Y.Z`) so multiple builds can coexist in `dist/` and
the Save As default name in Max already carries the version. `dist/`
only ever holds frozen / signed-and-notarized artefacts.

- **m4l** → `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` — frozen `.amxd`. The skill
  bakes + stages an un-frozen versioned copy at
  `m4l/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` (gitignored) in Step 1.6; the user opens
  that file in Max, Freezes, and Save-As's into `dist/` (default
  filename is already correct). See
  [ADR 004](../../../docs/ai/adr/archive/004-m4l-bake-distribution.md)
  and [ADR 006](../../../docs/ai/adr/006-m4l-release-verification.md).
- **vst** → `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg` (recommended installer) **and**
  `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg` (drag-to-install fallback) — both signed /
  notarized / stapled, built in lockstep by `make release-vst`. The
  build scripts read the version from `vst/CMakeLists.txt`.
  Distribution is via Polar (out of band, not GitHub). Both artifacts
  are uploaded. See
  [ADR 005 §Distribution posture](../../../docs/ai/adr/archive/005-product-split.md)
  and [ADR 007 §Distribution](../../../docs/ai/adr/archive/007-vst-architecture.md).

## Pre-flight checks (do these BEFORE the publish step)

Once a release ships (m4l: tag pushed + GH release; vst: dmg
uploaded to the paid platform), it is harder to undo cleanly. Run
all checks; STOP and ask the user if any fail.

### Check 1 — Working tree is clean

`git status --porcelain` must be empty. Uncommitted changes leak
into the release context. Halt if dirty.

### Check 2 — main is synced with origin

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet
git rev-list --count main..origin/main   # must be 0 (origin not ahead)
git rev-list --count origin/main..main   # must be 0 (local not ahead)
```

If origin is ahead, `git pull`. If local is ahead, push first
(via `/commit` for any unstaged work, then a normal push). Then
re-run.

### Check 3 — CI is green on HEAD

```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 5 --json conclusion,headSha,workflowName
```

The most recent completed run for the current HEAD SHA must have
`conclusion: "success"`. If still in progress or failed, halt and
ask. Don't ship distribution artifacts past a red gate — chasing
"probably just CI flake" has historically masked real regressions.

(For **m4l**, the asset freshness gate now lives in Step 1.6 — the
bake + stage + freeze flow runs after Step 1 picks the version, so
the dist filename `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` isn't known yet at
pre-flight time. For **vst**, the build is run by the skill itself
in Step 1.6 and the artifact freshness check lives there too.)

## Drafting

After pre-flight passes:

### Step 1 — Determine next version

The second $ARGUMENT is the bump (default `patch`). `none` is
**vst-only** and means "keep the current version, just regenerate
artifacts" — useful when only bundled docs / readmes change and the
plug-in binary doesn't actually need a new version.

For **m4l**, parse the highest `m4l-v*` tag and bump per the second
$ARGUMENT:

```bash
git tag -l 'm4l-v*' | sort -V | tail -1
```

(`none` is rejected for m4l — m4l version metadata isn't in-tree, so
re-freezing at the same version would just produce a duplicate tag,
which the skill blocks.)

For **vst**, no tags are created — the in-tree
`project(Stencil VERSION X.Y.Z)` line in `vst/CMakeLists.txt` is the
authoritative previous version. Bump from there, or keep with `none`:

```bash
grep '^project(Stencil VERSION' vst/CMakeLists.txt
```

If no prior version exists for this target, propose `m4l-v0.1.0` /
`0.1.0`.

Show the proposed version to the user and **confirm before
proceeding**. The user can override.

### Step 1.5 — Bump version metadata (vst only; skipped on `none`)

If Step 1 resolved to a new version (bump): edit
`vst/CMakeLists.txt` so `project(Stencil VERSION X.Y.Z)` matches the
target version, commit, and push to main BEFORE the build runs in
Step 1.6. The plist version reported to the DAW and the `v…` label
drawn in the editor header both come from this line.

```bash
# In vst/CMakeLists.txt, line 2:
# project(Stencil VERSION <old>) → project(Stencil VERSION <new>)
git add vst/CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m "chore(vst): bump version to X.Y.Z"
git push origin main
```

If Step 1 was `none` (regen at same version): skip this step
entirely — nothing to commit, nothing to push. Proceed to Step 1.6
so the build picks up whatever other source changes triggered the
regen (e.g. bundled README / INSTALL.txt fixes).

For m4l this step is skipped — m4l version metadata isn't
in-tree (the freeze captures whatever is on disk).

### Step 1.6 — Build / stage and verify (target-specific)

For **vst**, run `make release-vst` to produce both artifacts
(codesign + notarize + staple + dmg + pkg are wrapped in the script
chain):

```bash
make release-vst
```

This takes a few minutes — notarization is the long leg (waits on
Apple's service). Requires `DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID` env var +
`im9-notary` keychain profile + `Developer ID Application` and
`Developer ID Installer` certs in the login keychain. If
`make release-vst` fails, halt and surface the error; do not retry
blindly — notarization rejections, expired certs, and missing env
all need investigation before re-run.

After build, verify both artifacts are present, fresh, and have a
stapled notarization ticket (filenames carry the version parsed by
the build scripts from `vst/CMakeLists.txt`):

```bash
ls -la dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg
stat -f '%m' dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg                # mtime as epoch
stat -f '%m' dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg                # mtime as epoch
git log -1 --format=%ct -- vst/Source/ \
                            vst/CMakeLists.txt \
                            vst/scripts/ \
                            vst/tests/              # latest vst-source commit time
xcrun stapler validate dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg
xcrun stapler validate dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg
```

Both `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg` AND `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg` mtimes
must be **>=** the latest vst-source commit time, and `stapler
validate` must succeed on both. If either check fails, halt —
something went wrong in build or notarization.

Manual host smoke (Logic AU MIDI FX + Bitwig VST3/CLAP MIDI fx) is
recommended before handing the artifacts off to Polar.

**vst stops here.** Steps 2-5 are m4l-only. Upload both artifacts to
Polar and write the listing copy out of band.

---

For **m4l**, run `make release-m4l` with the version from Step 1 to
bake the host bundle and stage a versioned, un-frozen copy of the
baked `.amxd` next to the source bake target. `dist/` is for frozen
artefacts only — the un-frozen staging file lives in `m4l/`
(gitignored as `m4l/Stencil-v*.amxd`) so the Save As dialog opens
with the versioned filename pre-filled when the user freezes.

```bash
make release-m4l VERSION=X.Y.Z
```

Output: `m4l/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` (un-frozen). Then prompt the user:

> Open `m4l/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` in Max → click the snowflake
> (Freeze) button in the patcher toolbar → *File → Save As* →
> navigate to `dist/` and save (the default filename
> `Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` is already correct — just confirm the
> location).

**Wait for the user to confirm freeze + Save As is complete** before
continuing. Then verify the saved `.amxd` exists in `dist/` and its
mtime is fresher than the latest m4l-source commit:

```bash
stat -f '%m' dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd               # mtime as epoch
git log -1 --format=%ct -- m4l/Stencil.maxpat \
                            m4l/stencil.mjs \
                            m4l/registerRing.jsui.js \
                            m4l/registerRing.subpatcher.maxpat \
                            m4l/rangeSlider.jsui.js \
                            m4l/rangeSlider.subpatcher.maxpat \
                            m4l/separator-renderer.js \
                            m4l/engine m4l/host      # latest m4l-source commit time
```

If `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` is missing or older, halt and re-prompt
— the user didn't actually Save As into `dist/`.

**Manual smoke test in a fresh Live track is recommended before
tagging** — drag `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` onto a new MIDI track,
confirm it loads, plays, the bit ring renders, FREEZE / ROLL
respond. CI does not (and cannot) cover this.

### Step 2 — Draft release notes (m4l only)

For **vst**, skip this step — the skill does not draft listing copy
for Polar. Write the Polar product / release description out of band.

For **m4l**, compute the previous-release boundary (highest `m4l-v*`
tag) and generate the changelog from the commit log between it and
HEAD:

```bash
PREV=$(git tag -l 'm4l-v*' | sort -V | tail -1)
git log "${PREV:-}"..HEAD --pretty=format:'- %s' -- m4l/
```

If `$PREV` is empty (first m4l release), use the project root as the
lower bound.

Categorize commits by their `type:` prefix into sections:

- **Features** — `feat:`
- **Fixes** — `fix:`
- **Docs / housekeeping** — `docs:` / `chore:` / `style:` / `refactor:`
- **CI / build** — `ci:`

Drop the `Co-Authored-By` lines and trailing housekeeping noise.
Keep the section short — release notes are for users, not
contributors; detailed history is in `git log`.

For the very first m4l release, use a project-intro template
("What it does" / "Install" / "Requirements") instead of a changelog.

Write the draft to `/tmp/stencil-m4l-vX.Y.Z-notes.md` and show it to
the user. **Wait for explicit "ok" or edit instructions** before
continuing. The file is fed to `gh release create --notes-file` in
Step 3.

### Step 3 — Tag, push, create release (m4l only)

For **vst**, skip this step entirely — see the paid-pivot block at
the top. vst's flow already ended at Step 1.6 with both artifacts in
`dist/` and (when bumping) the CMakeLists bump committed; Polar
upload happens out of band.

```bash
TAG=m4l-vX.Y.Z
ASSET=dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd
TITLE="Stencil m4l vX.Y.Z"

git tag "$TAG"
git push origin "$TAG"
gh release create "$TAG" "$ASSET" \
  --title "$TITLE" \
  --notes-file "/tmp/stencil-$TAG-notes.md"
```

### Step 4 — Verify (m4l only)

```bash
gh release view "$TAG" --json name,tagName,assets,url
```

Confirm:

- `assets[0].name` is `Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd`.
- `assets[0].size` > 0 and matches the local file's size.
- The release URL is reachable.

Show the release URL to the user.

### Step 5 — Cleanup (m4l only)

```bash
rm "/tmp/stencil-m4l-vX.Y.Z-notes.md"
```

## Rules

- **Asset is target-specific.** m4l → `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd`
  (frozen); vst → both `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.pkg`
  (signed/notarized/stapled installer) and `dist/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.dmg`
  (signed/notarized/stapled drag-to-install). Never mix.
- **Filenames embed the version.** vst build scripts read the version
  from `vst/CMakeLists.txt` (single source of truth). m4l's
  `make release-m4l` takes `VERSION=X.Y.Z` from the skill (m4l
  version metadata isn't in-tree) and copies the baked `.amxd` to
  `m4l/Stencil-vX.Y.Z.amxd` (un-frozen, gitignored). The user opens
  that in Max, Freezes, and Save-As's into `dist/` — the Save As
  dialog pre-fills the versioned filename, so they just confirm.
- **`dist/` is for frozen / shipped artefacts only.** Un-frozen
  staging files live in `m4l/` (gitignored) for m4l, and signed +
  notarized bundles + dmg + pkg land directly in `dist/` for vst.
  Never write un-frozen `.amxd` into `dist/`.
- **m4l publishes to GitHub; vst does not.** m4l tags `m4l-vX.Y.Z`,
  creates a GH release, attaches the `.amxd`. vst skips Step 3/4
  entirely — no tag, no GH release, no asset upload. vst's dmg + pkg
  are handed off to the paid platform out of band.
- **vst version source of record = CMakeLists.** Since vst has no
  tags, `project(Stencil VERSION X.Y.Z)` in `vst/CMakeLists.txt` is
  the single authoritative version. Bump at Step 1.5 (skipped on
  `none`) and commit + push before Step 1.6 builds the artifacts.
- **Manual Freeze required for m4l.** Max has no CLI freeze; this
  skill does not automate it.
- **`make release-vst` runs inside the skill (Step 1.6).** Both the
  dmg and the pkg are built + signed + notarized + stapled by the
  script chain (`codesign.sh` → `notarize.sh` → `build-dmg.sh` →
  `build-pkg.sh`). The skill invokes it after Step 1.5 — the user
  doesn't run it manually. Requires `DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID` +
  `im9-notary` keychain profile + signing certs in the login
  keychain.
- **`none` bump is vst-only.** A vst regen at the same version is
  for doc-only fixes (bundled README / INSTALL.txt) where the
  plug-in binary doesn't need a version change. Step 1.5 is skipped;
  Step 1.6 still rebuilds artifacts so the new bundled files land in
  dmg + pkg.
- **Tag once, never re-tag (m4l).** If an `m4l-v*` tag for the
  proposed version already exists, bump again rather than
  overwrite. Force-deleting a tag that was already pushed is messy
  and breaks anyone who pulled it.
- **Notes via `--notes-file`, not `--notes`** (m4l). The temp-file
  flow lets the user edit before publish. vst has no notes-drafting
  step — write the Polar listing copy out of band.
- **Halt on any pre-flight failure.** Don't release past a red
  gate.
- **Halt on any user-confirmation gate.** Steps 1 (version) and 2
  (notes) require explicit "ok" — don't proceed silently.
